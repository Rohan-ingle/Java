# Java Program for Sorting Even and Odd Numbers

This Java program accepts numbers from the user and sorts them into two arrays based on whether they are even or odd.

## Files

### Main.java

This file contains the main logic of the program. It declares two arrays `even` and `odd` to store even and odd numbers respectively. It uses classes `input` and `numCheck` for input handling and checking if a number is even or odd.

### input.java

This file contains the `input` class, which handles user input. It prompts the user to enter the total number of elements and then accepts individual numbers.

### numCheck.java

This file contains the `numCheck` class, which checks whether a given number is even or odd.

## How to Run

1. Compile the Java files using `javac Main.java input.java numCheck.java`.
2. Run the compiled Java program using `java Main`.
3. Follow the on-screen prompts to enter the total number of elements and the numbers themselves.
4. The program will then print out the sorted even and odd numbers.
