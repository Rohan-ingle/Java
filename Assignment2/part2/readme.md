# Java Method for Finding Neighboring Numbers with Smallest Distance

This Java method finds two neighboring numbers in an array with the smallest distance between them and returns the index of the first number.

## Files

### Main.java

This file contains the main logic of the program. It uses classes `input` and `distance` to handle user input and calculate the distances between neighboring elements.

### input.java

This file contains the `input` class, which handles user input. It prompts the user to enter the total number of elements and then accepts individual numbers.

### distance.java

This file contains the `distance` class, which calculates the distances between neighboring elements and finds the index of the first number with the smallest distance to its neighbor.

## How to Run

1. Compile the Java files using `javac Main.java input.java distance.java`.
2. Run the compiled Java program using `java Main`.
3. Follow the on-screen prompts to enter the total number of elements and the numbers themselves.
4. The program will then print out the distances between neighboring elements and the index of the first number with the smallest distance to its neighbor.
