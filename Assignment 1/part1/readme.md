This Java program is designed to offer a simple, interactive console application that allows users to perform two mathematical operations: calculating the factorial of a given number and generating a Fibonacci sequence up to a specified term. Here's a detailed summary of each function within the program:

    Main Function (main(String[] args)):
        The main function serves as the entry point of the program. It initializes a BufferedReader to read user input from the console.
        It presents a looped menu with three options: calculating a factorial, generating a Fibonacci sequence, or exiting the program. The loop continues until the user chooses to exit.
        User choices are handled using a switch statement. Depending on the input, the program either calls the factorial calculation function, the Fibonacci sequence generation function, or breaks the loop to exit.

    Factorial Calculation (calculateFactorial(int n)):
        This function takes an integer n as input and calculates its factorial using recursion. The base cases are defined for n equal to 0 or 1, both returning 1, as the factorial of 0 and 1 is 1.
        For values of n greater than 1, the function recursively calls itself with n-1, multiplying the result by n until it reaches the base case. This effectively calculates the factorial of n.

    Fibonacci Sequence Generation (generateFibonacci(int numTerms)):
        This function is designed to print out the first numTerms of the Fibonacci sequence. It initializes the first two terms of the sequence, 0 and 1, and iteratively calculates subsequent terms by summing the last two terms.
        The sequence is generated in a loop that runs numTerms times, updating the values of the two terms after each iteration to reflect the next term in the sequence. The current term is printed out in each iteration, displaying the Fibonacci sequence up to the specified number of terms.
