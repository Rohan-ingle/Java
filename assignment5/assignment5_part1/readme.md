# Geometric Shapes

This Java project includes classes representing basic geometric shapes, each implementing a `Shape` interface.

## Classes

### Shape

- An interface defining methods `Area()` and `Perimeter()`.

### Circle

- Represents a circle with a radius.
- Constructor: `Circle(int radius)`
- Methods:
  - `Area()`: Calculates the area using the formula πr².
  - `Perimeter()`: Calculates the perimeter using the formula 2πr.
  - `getRadius()`: Returns the circle's radius.
  - `setRadius(int radius)`: Sets the circle's radius.

### Rectangle

- Represents a rectangle (assumed from usage in `Main.java`).
- Likely methods: `Area()`, `Perimeter()`, along with getters and setters for dimensions.

### Triangle

- Represents a triangle (assumed from usage in `Main.java`).
- Likely methods: `Area()`, `Perimeter()`, along with getters and setters for sides and possibly angles.
